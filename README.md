# Count_Collinear_Triples
Counts triples that are collinear from 3 arrays of 2 dimensional points

This program is part of an assignment for second year Algorithms and Data Structures.
The code that I wrote is contained in the Collinear and CollinearTest classes, in the csu22011_a1 package. Most of the other files are provided by my lecturer.
